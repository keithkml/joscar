Warning ("eviling") is the AIM way of telling a buddy that you don't like what they're doing. With higher warning levels come lower rate limits, so this is an effective way of limiting someone who is spamming you.

=== Warn buddy command ===
From WarnBuddySnac:
[[Include(WarnBuddySnac)]]

=== Warn acknowledgment ===
The Warn Ack command is sent by the OSCAR server as a SnacResponse to the WarnBuddySnac. The format of this packet is dependent on the success of the warn operation.

==== Successful warning ====

 * SnacCommand family 0x04, 0x09
  * UnsignedShort: {{{amountWarned}}}
  * UnsignedShort: {{{newLevel}}}

{{{amountWarned}}} is the amount the user warned the buddy in that warning. If the buddy were at 30% and 
the user warned them to 40%, this would be 10%; note, as with other warning packets, these numbers are the 
warning level times 10. (30% = 300)

{{{newLevel}}} is the buddy's new warning level, once again, their level times 10.

==== Failed warning ====

 * SnacCommand family 0x04, 0x09
  * UnsignedShort: {{{unknown}}} (usually 0x000d)
  * TlvBlock type 0x0008
   * UnsignedShort: {{{unknown}}}

The meanings of the data portions are unknown.

=== Warned command ===
From WarnedSnac:
[[Include(WarnedSnac)]]
