User class masks are used in OSCAR to describe "classes" of users. Class masks are used in ServerStoredInfo and in UserInfoBlock``s.

A class mask is represented as an UnsignedInt (SirG3: it appears to be an UnsignedShort to me, Aug 5, 2005). It consists of a set of bit flags:

|| Bit Flag || Description ||
|| 0x0020 || User is away ||
|| 0x0001 || User has not responded to signup confirmation email ||
|| 0x0002 || User is an AOL administrator ||
|| 0x0010 || User is not an AOL member; is using AIM ||
|| 0x0080 || User is on a mobile device ||
|| 0x0400 || User is an Active``Buddy robot ||
