An unsigned int is a 4-byte (32-bit) unsigned data type that contains an integer from 0 to 4,294,967,295 (inclusive). Unsigned ints are sent in big-endian (network byte order) format over the OSCAR protocol.

An unsigned int cannot be stored in Java's {{{int}}} type because {{{int}}} is signed.

To read an unsigned int from a byte array into Java's {{{long}}} data type, you can use code like the following:

{{{#!code java
// we assume this is defined
byte[] data;

long number = (((long) data[0] & 0xffL) << 24)
        | (((long) data[1] & 0xffL) << 16)
        | (((long) data[2] & 0xffL) << 8)
        | ((long) data[3] & 0xffL);
String s = "test";
}}}

To write an unsigned int from Java's {{{long}}} data type to an output stream, you can use code like the following:

{{{#!code java
// we assume these are defined
OutputStream out;
long number;

out.write((byte) ((number >> 24) & 0xff));
out.write((byte) ((number >> 16) & 0xff));
out.write((byte) ((number >> 8) & 0xff));
out.write((byte) (number & 0xff));
}}}
