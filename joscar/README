AOL Instant Messenger protocol library for Java

1. ABOUT JOSCAR

joscar is an extensible low-level Java interface into AOL Instant Messenger's
OSCAR protocol from both the client and the server side.  The joscar library 
aims to provide implementations of individual commands as well as higher-level 
classes for easily managing data structures in the most common ways.

While joscar was designed mainly to be a client library, much of the
functionality necessary to implement an AIM server is there.  All commands and
data structures can be both read in from and written out to a stream of bytes.

joscar currently depends heavily on features only available in the Java 1.4
class library, such as nio's Charset classes.  For further information, please
see the RELNOTES file included with this distribution.

The joscar source code is released under a BSD-style license, which means you
are free to do whatever you please with it as long as you don't hold the Joust
Project accountable.  For legal details, please see the LICENSE file included 
with this distribution.

2. ABOUT THE JOUST PROJECT

The Joust Project is a set of three subprojects aiming to provide a Java
interface to AOL Instant Messenger's Oscar protocol on three levels:

   - as an end user of AOL's (or another party's) instant messaging services
   - as a client developer for the above
   - for other more low-level purposes (developing an Oscar server, etc.)

Three separate components exist for these three purposes:

   - Joust, a fully featured AIM client, building upon
   - jouscar, a high-level client interface to AIM, building upon
   - joscar, a low-level library for managing the raw data structures involved
     in an Oscar connection.

For more information regarding the status of these sub-projects, or to download 
releases, please visit the Joust Project web site (http://joust.kano.net/).

3. OBTAINING JOSCAR

You can obtain the latest joscar release, as well as previous versions of the
library, from the Joust Project web site (http://joust.kano.net/), or from the 
Joust Project SourceForge project page (http://sf.net/projects/joustim).

If you like working with bleeding-edge code, you may sync with the joscar CVS
trunk hosted on SourceForge.  For instructions, please see the UPDATING file
included with this distribution.

4. CONTACTING THE JOUST PROJECT

For any questions or general technical support issues, or if you're interested
in becoming a developer for the Joust Project, please send mail to 
<joust@kano.net>.

For the latest development and release news, please visit the Joust Project's 
web site (http://joust.kano.net/).  There, you can find information about the
various sub-projects, download releases, browse the CVS tree, read the
developers' weblog, and discuss the Joust Project with other developers.
Of particular interest is the developers' weblog, which is an invaluable
resource for anyone tracking Joust development (http://joust.kano.net/weblog/).

Bug reports, suggestions, and code contributions are appreciated and may be 
submitted by way of SourceForge (http://sf.net/projects/joustim/).  Use the 
Tracker tool to post bugs and suggestions, and use the Patches system to
submit code.

5. FURTHER READING

You should have received the following files with your joscar distribution.
If not, you may download an official joscar release from the Joust Project web
site (http://joust.kano.net/).

   - README:  This file, which gives some general information about joscar and
     the Joust Project.

   - RELNOTES:  The release notes, showing what's new and different in this
     joscar release, as well as what's changed in prior releases.

   - LICENSE:  The Joust Project license, describing the ways in which you may
     use joscar and the joscar source code.

   - UPDATING:  Instructions on getting the latest joscar source code from the
     SourceForge CVS repository.

   - BUILDING:  A quick guide to building joscar binaries and documentation 
     using the Apache Project's ant tool (http://ant.apache.org/).

   - USING:  A quick guide to using the joscar library and the bundled 
     JoscarTester program.

Additionally, your joscar distribution may include the Javadoc API reference
in the docs/api/ directory.  The latest copy of this documentation is available 
on the Joust Project web site (http://joust.kano.net/joscar/docs/api/).  If
you are using joscar in your projects, you should read this documentation, as
it contains important development information.

Your joscar distribution may also include the howto guide in the docs/howto/
directory.  The latest copy of this documentation is available on the Joust
Project web site (http://joust.kano.net/joscar/docs/howto/).  The howto is a
brief overview of the Oscar login process, and will have larger scope and far
more depth in future iterations.
