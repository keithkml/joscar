THE JOSCAR LIBRARY

The joscar library is heavily documented.  Every single class, method, and
field is fully documented, and developers working with the library are urged to
read through and understand the documentation of any and all classes he or she
is using.  You can find the documentation in the docs/api/ directory of this 
distribution, or on the Joust Project web site 
(http://joust.kano.net/joscar/docs/api/).

JOSCARTESTER

joscar is a rather complicated library, and may be intimidating to users new
to either the library, the protocol, or even the Java language itself.
Luckily, a "demo" called JoscarTester is included with this library.  While
JoscarTester is by no means a well-designed, high-quality implementation of a
joscar-based application, it can be a starting point for implementing your
own applications using joscar.

JoscarTester (and its numerous related classes) is located in the source
directory; the classes exist in their entirety in the net.kano.joscardemo
package.  To run JoscarTester, simply run 'java
net.kano.joscardemo.JoscarTester <screenname> <password>' and it will attempt
to log into AOL Instant Messenger with the given screenname.  It has a simple
command-line interface that may be explained here later; scroll to near the
bottom of JoscarTester.java for the two lists of commands.

(NOTE that the joscardemo package is not included in the given .jar file.  It
 must be compiled from source!)

Some somewhat messy classpath hacking will probably be necessary to run
JoscarTester. Try something like this in your home joscar direcory:

    java -cp bin:demo/bin net.kano.joscardemo.JoscarTester <username> <password>

Alternatively, you can run the demo if you have Ant installed by running the
"run-demo" target included with joscar's Ant build file:

    ant run-demo

Unfortunately, this method does not allow user input, so using this method
prevents one from using JoscarTester's command-line interface.

AIM 5.2 SECURE IM / PERSONAL CERTIFICATES

joscar implements the necessary data structures and SNAC commands used in AIM's
new secure IM / personal certificates feature.

To test the new secure IM, direct connection, file transfer, and chat room 
features in the JoscarTester demo, you must create a PKCS12 keystore containing
a signed X509v3 certificate and private RSA key in the same format as AIM 
itself requires. (See http://ragweed.net/aimcrypt for details on how to make 
your own.) This PKCS12 store must be called "certificate-info.p12" and must 
reside in the current working directory of JoscarTester.

In addition, you must download the joscar-extras package from the Joust website
and extract it to the same directory in which the joscar package was extracted.
Your joscar distribution should have a demo/extras/ directory containing source
files in src/ and two jar files in lib/. You will need to recompile the demo
(with 'ant demo') and add the two jars in demo/extras/lib/ to the classpath when
running JoscarTester. (Note that 'ant run-demo' does this for you.)

When running under these conditions, the screenname on which JoscarTester is
running should appear on AIM 5.2 users' buddy lists with a padlock icon next to
his name. Buddies using AIM 5.2 (or JoscarTester) who also have certificates
loaded will be able to talk to him securely (over RSA PKI encryption), send him
files over SSL, and invite him to "Secure Chat Rooms." JoscarTester can also
initiate all of these things; you can look at the JoscarTester source for the
commands if you are curious.
